--- title: "machinelearning" author: "DJMcClellan" date: "August 20, 2015" output: html_document --- #Machine Learning The goal of this project is to predict the manner the exercises where done from the data at the [website](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har), see the section on Weight Lifting Exercise). The exercises were put into 5 different classes: (Class A) exactly according to the specification, (Class B) throwing the elbows to the front, (Class C) lifting the dumbbell only halfway, (Class D) lowering the dumbbell only halfway, (Class E) throwing the hips to the front . ##Executive summary Using various machine learning techniques from the [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://class.coursera.org/predmachlearn-031), especially the [Caret Package](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html). I hope to predict accurately the way the exercises were done, first by downloading and cleaning the data. The methods of analysis will be finding and removing na values, creating training, testing and validation sets, removing any high correlation values and predicting answers. Findings after creating the pmltrain and pmltest there were 406 missing values that need to be removed, after cleaning there were no near zero values. In my training set I identified correlated predicitors, that I hoped after removing might help my models. Using the caret packeage to preprocess the with the pca method, along with random forest and crossvalidation, I created a model with 96% model accuracy. ###Data The training data for this project are available [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv) The test data are available [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv) ```{r} rm(list=ls()) #clean up the console for clarity setwd("~/Desktop/coursera /machine learning") #set local work directory download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv",destfile="training.csv", method="curl") pmltrain <- read.csv("training.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE) download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv",destfile="testing.csv", method="curl") pmltest <- read.csv("testing.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE) ``` ### Data Analysis Creating training and test data sets ```{r} sum(complete.cases(pmltrain)) #get sum of missing values from data pmltrain <- pmltrain[, colSums(is.na(pmltrain)) == 0] #change na values into zero pmltest <- pmltest[, colSums(is.na(pmltest)) == 0] #change na values into zero #remove columns from train and test by name pmltrain<- pmltrain[, !grepl("X|user_name|timestamp|window", colnames(pmltrain))] pmltest<- pmltest[, !grepl("X|user_name|timestamp|window", colnames(pmltest))] pmltrainclean <- pmltrain[, !grepl("^max|^min|^ampl|^var|^avg|^stdd|^ske|^kurt", colnames(pmltrain))] pmltestclean<- pmltest[, !grepl("^max|^min|^ampl|^var|^avg|^stdd|^ske|^kurt", colnames(pmltest))] set.seed(2015) # for reproducibilty library(caret) dim(pmltrainclean) str(pmltrainclean) table(pmltrainclean$classe) qplot(pmltrainclean$classe) #plot of classe library(AppliedPredictiveModeling) # snapshot of some of the data in training set transparentTheme(trans = .4) featurePlot(x = pmltrainclean[, 8:13], y = pmltrainclean$classe, plot = "pairs") summary(pmltrainclean) # create training, testing and validation set from clean data intrain <- createDataPartition(pmltrainclean$classe,p=0.6,list=FALSE) train <- pmltrainclean[intrain,] valid <- pmltrainclean[-intrain,] test <- pmltestclean dim(train); dim(valid); dim(test) #find and remove near zero values if need to nzv <- nearZeroVar(train) nzv # no values to remove #correlation cortrain <- cor(train[,-53]) summary(cortrain[upper.tri(cortrain)]) highcor <- findCorrelation(cortrain, cutoff= .75) #remove high correlation vaules filteredcor <- cortrain[, -highcor] cortrain2 <- cor(filteredcor) summary(cortrain2[upper.tri(cortrain2)]) library(corrplot) corrplot(cortrain, method = "color") ``` ###Preprocess data with caret ```{r} #use caret to process data preproc <- preProcess(train[,-53], method = c('pca','center','scale'), thresh = 0.95) predtrain <- predict(preproc, train[, -53]) predvalid <- predict(preproc, valid[, -53]) predtest <- predict(preproc, test[, -53]) dim(predtrain);dim(predvalid); dim(predtest) ``` ###Modeling ```{r} train$classe <- as.factor(train$classe) modelfit <- train(train$classe~., method = "rf", ntree = 250, data = predtrain, trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 10)) modelfit #the importance of the predictor variables in the final model are plotted.
